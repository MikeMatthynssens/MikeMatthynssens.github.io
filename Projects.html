    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Here I'll talk about the Midterm project and what I learned. Maybe include a code video or two. The real emphasis should be on what I learned so I'll have to redo it with the switches or whatever Adam did so I can show how much leaner the code gets.</p>
    <h3>Original Code</h3>
        <p>Talk about thought process of original code</p>
    <h3>Improvements in Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Explain how to make the code itself leaner and how to better manage a project like this to avoid doing more work than needed (project management stuff might be nice in here).</p>
        
    <h3>This Site</h3>
        
        <p>At the end of the semeseter I should know enough to make a website with MVC included so I'll direct them to the parts of the website that highlight those skills</p>
